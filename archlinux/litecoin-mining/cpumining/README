will be required for startum support, as cpuminer doesn't have stratum support

Add the start_proxy.sh script to the stratum-mining-proxy folder after installing it and then run this script to start the local proxy server

and use the start_mining.sh script in the same folder as the "minerd" execcutable to start mining with wemineltc pool
