To add a new application for autostart in the .xinitrc based pantheon DE,
just before 'exec cerbere' line in .xinitrc,
add an eval command with appropriate command for starting the intended application from command-line:

e.g. eval 'guake &'
      ^      ^
      |      |
(eval comm.)(command for starting guake from command-line in background)
