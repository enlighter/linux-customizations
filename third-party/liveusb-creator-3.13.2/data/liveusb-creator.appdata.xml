      The LiveUSB Creator is a tool for easily installing live operating systems
      on to USB flash drives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Live USB Creator detects all of your removable devices and supports a
      completely non-destructive install.
      There is no need to deal with formatting or partitioning your USB key.
      You can also allocate extra space on your USB stick, allowing you to save
      files and make modifications to your live operating system that will
      persist after you reboot.
      This essentially lets you carry your own personalized Fedora with you at
      all times.
